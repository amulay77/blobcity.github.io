## Change User Password

```
{
  "username" : "root",
  "password" : "root",
  "q" : "change-user-password",
  "p" : {
    "username" : "username1",
    "new-password" : "password2"
  }
}
```

Sets the password of the specified user to the specified password. A valid old password of the user is not required to set a new password for the user, but the connecting user needs to have the `manage-user` role to set the password for another user. If the user whoâ€™s password is to be set is same as the connecting user, then no role or permission is required for the operation to succeed.

**Response Structure**

```
{
  "ack" : "1",
  "time" : 1000
}
```

Provides a simple acknowledgement confirming a change of password. If this response is an `ack` value of `1`, it ensures the password change and the old password will no longer work.
