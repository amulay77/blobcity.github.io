## Load Code

```
blobcity>change-user-password {username} {password}
```

Sets the password of the specified user to the specified password. The username is specified by the `{username}` parameter and the new password to set is specified by the `{password}` parameter. A valid old password of the user is not required to set a new password for the user, but the connecting user needs to have the `manage-user` role to set the password for another user. If the user whoâ€™s password is to be set is same as the connecting user, then no role or permission is required for the operation to succeed.
