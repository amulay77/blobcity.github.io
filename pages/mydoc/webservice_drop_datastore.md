## Drop Datastore

```
{
  "username" : "root",
  "password" : "root",
  "q" : "drop-ds",
  "p" : {
    "name" : "datastore1"
  }
}
```

The query drops the specified datastore if present. On successful execution of the request, the datastore with the specified name is guaranteed to be inexistent on the database cluster. The query is expected to return a success response even if the datastore with the specified name was in-existent when the query was fired.

**Response Structure**

```
{
  "ack" : "1",
  "time" : 1000,
  "p" : {
    "arch-code" : "xxx"
  }
}
```

Provides a simple success response, if at the end of the operation a datastore with the provided name does not exist in the database cluster.

The payload parameter can be ignored but is provided for maintaining compatibility. The `arch-code` represents an archive code that is generated by the database, which maps to the produced archive. The code can be used to restore the dropped datastore in the future if desired. The `list-archives` commands can be used in the future to fetch this code.
