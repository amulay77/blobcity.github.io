## XML Storage

BlobCity offers exhaustive support for XML storage. It allows storage and retrieval of XML, along with running queries on XML as if they were collected into a tabular structure.

A schema inference engine processes the XML document or object being submitted to BlobCity and maps to a tabular schema for appropriate indexing and search-ability. The XML elements are converted to column names, and the values encapsulated within the elements associate with the value of the particular column. Nesting of XML element is permitted with the nested tags forming a column name column name by concatenating the tags separated by a ‘.’ (dot).

Let us consider starting with an empty collection and then insert our first XML document into it. An empty collection is shown in figure below.

Consider an insert of the following XML document into our table.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<user>
    <name>John</name>
    <age>45</age>
</user>
```

The collection after taking the insert of the above XML appears as shown below.

**Collection with the 1st XML record inserted**

_id | user.name | user.age
----|----|----|
xxx | John | 45

The insert operation results in two columns getting automatically created within the collection. The columns are named `user.name` and `user.age` respectively. Although not visible within a collection schema, the `name` and `age` columns are actually placed within the user column. The `user` column will not show up in a collection schema, but it can be used to specify the columns to be selected in a select query, but cannot be used inside conditional where clauses or for any other purpose.

The response of all SQL queries is defaulted to a JSON array and is consistent with the response received against JSON data present within the collection. The XML is automatically mapped to equivalent JSON when running a SQL query. The database however stores the XML, and it can be fetched in its original form if explicitly specified. However the record cannot be retrieved in XML form as part of the SQL search query.

```
SELECT * FROM ds1.users
[
  {"user": {"name": "John", "age": 45}}
]
```

The response is a JSON array with each record being a JSON object entry within the array. A major difference between the working of the JSON and working of the XML document is that the name and age value actually get nested within the user key as was present in the original document. This may happen to be the case for most XML documents or objects you use. A standard practice with XML encapsulates the enters within a root tag, which results in the nesting.

The root tag and the XML format specification tag is not mandatory for BlobCity to infer the XML document. Let us see the table with an insert without the xml element at the beginning of the document.

```
<user>
    <name>Tom</name>
    <age>26</age>
</user>
```

**Collection with a 2nd XML record inserted**

_id | user.name | user.age
----|----|----|
xxx | John | 45
xxx | Tom | 26

The insert is successful with the collection getting an additional record. The xxx is the placeholder for auto-defined values, with the actual record containing a unique value that is auto generated by the database.

To explicitly specify the `_id` value for any element, the following XML structure needs to be used.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<_id>1000</_id>
<user>
    <name>Mary</name>
    <age>30</age>
</user>
```

**Collection with 3rd XML record having an explicitly specified _id value**

_id | user.name | user.age
----|----|----|
xxx | John | 45
xxx | Tom | 26
1000 | Mary | 30
